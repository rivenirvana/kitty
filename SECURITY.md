# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

There are no security specific releases of kitty. Security bugs are fixed
and released just like all other bugs.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Preferably send an email to kovid at kovidgoyal.net or open a private security
advisory using the GitHub security advisory facility.

Note that I will generally respond to security communication within 72 hours. Once
the bug is confirmed, it will be fixed or at least mitigated within another 72
hours, at which time the fix will typically be committed to master and hence be
public. That timeline might be extended based on the severity of the issue and the
current state of master in terms of making a new release, if so, it will be
done in consultation with the issue reporter.
