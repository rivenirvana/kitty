:code:`h` for hours or :code:`d` for days. Non-integer numbers are allowed.
If not specified, seconds is assumed. The notification is guaranteed to be closed automatically
after the specified time has elapsed. The notification could be closed before by user
action or OS policy.


--type -c
The notification type. Can be any string, it is used by users to create filter rules
for notifications, so choose something descriptive of the notifications, purpose.

is already displayed, it is replaced/updated.

your own identifier via the --identifier option.


--wait-till-closed -w
type=bool-set

"activated" is printed to STDOUT before quitting.


--only-print-escape-code
