  <summary>Cross-platform, fast, feature full, GPU based terminal emulator</summary>
  <description>
    <p>- Offloads rendering to the GPU for lower system load and buttery smooth
  scrolling. Uses threaded rendering to minimize input latency.

- Supports all modern terminal features: graphics (images), unicode, true-color,
  OpenType ligatures, mouse protocol, focus tracking, bracketed paste and
  several new terminal protocol extensions.

- Supports tiling multiple terminal windows side by side in different layouts
  without needing to use an extra program like tmux.

- Can be controlled from scripts or the shell prompt, even over SSH.

- Has a framework for Kittens, small terminal programs that can be used to
  extend kitty's functionality. For example, they are used for Unicode input,
  Hints and Side-by-side diff.

- Supports startup sessions which allow you to specify the window/tab layout,
  working directories and programs to run on startup.

- Cross-platform: kitty works on Linux and macOS, but because it uses only
  OpenGL for rendering, it should be trivial to port to other Unix-like
  platforms.

- Allows you to open the scrollback buffer in a separate window using arbitrary
  programs of your choice. This is useful for browsing the history comfortably
  in a pager or editor.

- Has multiple copy/paste buffers, like vim.</p>
